# Tech Stack Referee: Python vs Java (Week 6 – The Referee)

This project is a decision-support tool designed to help users compare
technology choices rather than consume one-sided recommendations.

## Problem
Most AI tools suggest a single "best" option without explaining trade-offs.
In real-world engineering, every technical decision involves compromises.

## Solution
A referee-style comparison tool that evaluates Python and Java based on
different contexts such as backend development, data processing, enterprise
systems, and learning curve.

## Trade-Off Focus
The tool highlights:
- Pros and cons of each option
- Context-based strengths and weaknesses
- A neutral trade-off explanation instead of a winner

## How Kiro Helped
Kiro’s structured reasoning approach helped break decision-making into
clear comparison rules, enabling transparent and explainable outcomes.
This reduced ambiguity and supported architect-level thinking.
